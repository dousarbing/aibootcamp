    ## Project Overview
    Welcome to the __ResiChat__ (Resale Intelligence Chat)! Our platform aims to assist buyers and sellers in the HDB resale market by providing intelligent insights, negotiation strategies, and price analysis using advanced language models.

        - ***Insights Analysis***: Allows users to interact with the chatbot to gain insights on various topics related to the HDB resale market.
